## About The Project
Kira Miki is a discord bot I have created out of boredum. I have used a lot of old code I've had in the past. But I have re-worked most of the code to work the way I want it to now. Kira has multiple different features. Varying from moderation, music, utility, to fun commands. I'm probably going to be working on this project for quite some time. So I guess whoever is following this and has an instance of thier own is going to get a little annoyed with how many updates I make. :smile: Keep in mind tho, some code you may notice you have maybe seen somewhere before. You may be correct, and you may not be. Some of the code I use in the bot was not technically made by me. I have ajusted some code to work the way I need it to. But I fully do not claim ***all*** of the code as mine.

## Usage
<p>
  Now how do I use the bot? Well it's simple, keep in mind that <b>[p]</b> = the prefix you set in your <b>config.yml</b>.
  <br/>
  Every command needs to started with your bots prefix. Like so <b>[p]play</b>, <b>[p]help</b>, <b>[p]ping</b>.
  <br/>
  To get all of the bots commands use the following <b>[p]help</b>.
  <br/>
  If you are wanting help on a specific module use the following <b>[p]help ModuleName</b>.
  <br/>
  Also if you're wanting help on a specific command use the following <b>[p]help CommandName</b>.
